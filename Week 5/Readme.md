 Week 5 document details our analysis of our project on Specialty Drug Cost Analysis in Medicare Advantage Plans. 
 This week, we focused on data cleaning, preprocessing, and integrating Medicare and Medicaid drug spending data. 
 Key tasks included standardizing column names, handling missing values, and resolving duplicate entries.

 
 We conducted a comparative analysis of spending trends (2018-2022), identified top cost-driving drugs, and assessed per-unit cost differences. 
 These findings set the stage for deeper policy analysis and cost optimization strategies.
