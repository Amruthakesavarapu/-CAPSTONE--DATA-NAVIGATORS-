This final stage of the project centered on developing a patient-focused presentation analyzing specialty drug costs in Medicare Advantage Plans. The goal was to blend storytelling, data analysis, and policy recommendations to highlight real-world impacts.

Structured a 14-slide PowerPoint featuring Patient X as a narrative anchor, with Revlimid and multiple myeloma as the case context. Slides included insights from Tableau visualizations covering average dose costs, price growth (CAGR), and prescription trends.

The presentation also featured policy strategies supported by APA-formatted sources, along with carefully crafted, reference-ready bullet points. Patient-centered language and real-life framing were prioritized to enhance clarity and impact.
