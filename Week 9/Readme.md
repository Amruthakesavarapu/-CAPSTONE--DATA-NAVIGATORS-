The Week 9 document focuses on finalizing per-unit cost analysis and validating specialty drugs in Medicare and Medicaid datasets. The objective was to refine cost analysis and support policy recommendations.

Using Pandas, we cleaned and validated the dataset by resolving duplicate drug entries, standardizing names, and applying fuzzy string matching. We verified all 45 remaining drugs as specialty medications using authoritative sources like CVS Specialty Pharmacy and the FDA.

The final dataset, with no missing data or inconsistencies, provides a reliable basis for further analysis. It highlights pricing inefficiencies where Medicare often overpays compared to Medicaid, supporting data-driven policy recommendations.
